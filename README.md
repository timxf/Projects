## Sales Data of Men’s Fashion Stores
• Conducted statistical analysis in linear regression to find out the factors that affect the sale of men’s fashion stores. 
• Applied data cleaning, visualization, and variable selection and developed a model to predict the sale of men's fashion stores. 

## Red Wine Quality Prediction Based on Chemical Properties
• Conducted statistical analysis in generalized linear model, classification tree and random forest to find if wines’ chemical properties can accurately predict the quality of the wine. 
• Applied data cleaning, visualization, and variable selection in R.

## Analyze of Interest Rate- Modeling and Foresting Time Series
• Analyzed ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and Neutral Networking models to find out the best model to forecast interest rate. 
• Utilized cross validation to optimized each model using R and Excel.
